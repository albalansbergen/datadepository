# datadepository
Data depository of my Bachelor Final Project.

This is a collection of the code I used for the analysis and used to produce the figures. Besides the Table with all the outcomes is given for both pdms and pdes. The input files for the simulations can also be found in here.

The code for shapiro3.py and shapiro_manually.py were both taken from the original paper and adjusted such that it would work with my data set. https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0207835

I would also like to state that I am not a professional programmer in any sense, the programs have been created due to the dire need of order.
